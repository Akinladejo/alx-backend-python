Import wait_random from the previous python file that
youâ€™ve written and write an async routine called wait_n
that takes in 2 int arguments: max_delay and n. You will
spawn wait_random n times with the specified max_delay.

wait_n should return the list of all the delays (float values)
The list of the delays should be in ascending order without
using sort() because of concurrency.
