# Async IO Project

This project demonstrates the use of asynchronous I/O in Python, focusing on the following key concepts:
- `async` and `await` syntax
- Executing async programs with `asyncio`
- Running concurrent coroutines
- Creating `asyncio` tasks
- Using the `random` module

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Explain `async` and `await` syntax
- Execute an async program with `asyncio`
- Run concurrent coroutines
- Create `asyncio` tasks
- Use the `random` module

## Requirements

- A `README.md` file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.7)
- All files should end with a new line
- All files must be executable
- The length of files will be tested using `wc`
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- Code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5.x)
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated
- All modules should have documentation
- All functions should have documentation

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python 3.7 installed. You can create a virtual environment and install necessary packages using:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
