# Asynchronous Generators and Comprehensions Project

## Description
This project demonstrates the use of asynchronous generators and comprehensions in Python, along with type annotations for generators. The examples provided are meant to help understand how to write asynchronous generators, use async comprehensions, and properly type-annotate generators.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Write an asynchronous generator.
- Use async comprehensions.
- Type-annotate generators.

## Requirements
- **Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Environment:** Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with Python 3.7
- **Code Style:** Follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.5.x)
- **Documentation:** All modules and functions should have docstrings explaining their purpose.
- **File Length:** Ensure all files end with a new line. Check the length using `wc`.

## Usage
To run the asynchronous generator example, execute:

```sh
python3 async_gen.py
